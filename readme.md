Coursera Progfun Solutions
==========================
The famous Introduction to Functional Programming MOOC by Martin Odersky.  
  
The course hasn't opened in 2015 and I decided to begin the course by myself
anyway. I took this course in 2012 but I couldn't keep up with it.  Because the 
content were too heavy for me to follow at that time. After getting used to 
functional programming over time, I can enjoy this course now.
  
An unimportant note
-------------------
The course is designed to be developed in Eclipse. But my choice of editor is
IntelliJ. I had hard times importing the project into IntelliJ directly and
I gave up trying. I found the solution on creating a new project on IntelliJ and
copying the files onto it. That's why my project hierarchy looks different than 
it should be.
